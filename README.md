<h1>Gayelak iOS App</h1>


<h2>About The App</h2>
<p>Gayelak is AI, Location based mobile application  app that connects nearby people with each other to sell and products easily. 
</p>
<p>Gayelak founded by me to help my university students to find cheap used products.</p>
<p>What makes Gayelak unique is the AI image detection feature so that with only one picture the user could post the item
without any description, where our system pick the most accurate tags to the product. We are also planing to add more AI features
like price prediction and category prediction.
